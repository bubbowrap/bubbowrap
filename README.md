# Hey, I'm Jeremy!

I'm a front-end developer and designer from Florida (I know) who loves making cool stuff for the web. Currently, I'm ***deep*** into building things using Vue.js. [Contact me](mailto:bubbowrap@gmail.com) if you're curious about any of my projects, or check out my [site](https://jeremysamuel.dev) for more info; though really, everything's already right here 🤷🏾‍♂️
